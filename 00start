# W.I.P. script, made by USBhost.
# for this script to work you need busbox.
# made for the Nexus 9.
#

# the 'FI.d' folder
# is meant for values that dont stay at boot
# because the system overwrites them just after bootup.
# so to fix this, is to apply a wait time before it executes.
# wake lock is needed because if the system suspends
# FI.d/init.d scripts may not execute.
	echo tmp_lock > /sys/power/wake_lock && log -p i -t FI.d " started "
# mount cache
	busybox mount -t ext4 -o rw,noatime,barrier=0,noload,errors=continue /dev/block/platform/sdhci-tegra.3/by-name/CAC /cache || busybox mount -t auto -o rw,noatime,defaults /dev/block/platform/sdhci-tegra.3/by-name/CAC /cache || log -p i -t FI.d " no busybox "
# start init.d
	busybox run-parts /system/etc/init.d/
# set wait time
	log -p i -t FI.d " wait 1min " && sleep 60
